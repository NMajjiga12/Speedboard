## Compatibility

- Tested on **Windows 10/11**  
- Python 3.9‚Äì3.11 compatible  
- Requires basic system terminal or CMD for running from source

```
PyQt6
```

You can install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Your `requirements.txt` should look like:

```
PyQt6
```

## Installation

### Pre-Built

A standalone Windows executable can be created using PyInstaller.  
Once built, run `main.exe` from the `dist` folder. No Python installation required.

Steps:

1. Download the file from the releases tab
2. Extract and double click on the file and the GUI should popup
3. Click the save all and update leaderboard button to 

---

### From Source

1. Download and unzip this repository  
2. *(Optional)* Create a virtual environment  
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Getting Started

The application consists of:

- `main.py`: Entry point  
- `src/leaderboard_backend.py`: Backend logic  
- `src/leaderboard_frontend.py`: PyQt6 GUI  
- `leaderboard.html`: HTML output used for display or saving  

You can run `main.py` to launch the full frontend and backend interface.

---

## Usage

- Add or update leaderboard entries via the GUI  
- Times are sorted and saved through backend logic  
- Output is formatted and stored in `leaderboard.html` which can be added to OBS by copy-pasting the absolute path
- You can view or embed the HTML file externally for sharing leaderboard standings  

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the app fails to import modules, make sure you‚Äôre running from the root folder and have used the `--paths=src` flag for PyInstaller  
- If `leaderboard.html` is not updating automatically, you will have to click 
- For missing dependencies, reinstall with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
